    "section": "Assessment",
    "text": "Assessment\nYour learning will be assessed in a variety of ways including Attendance and Participation (AP), CPA’s, Labs, Problem Sets (PS), Projects, Exams, and a final Portfolio (takes the place of a final exam). Below are the details on these components.\n\nAttendance and Participation (AP)\nYou’re expected to attend all classes and participate during class discussions. Consistent attendance and participation are strong indicators of success in MAT 104. You will be responsible for all course material, announcements, quizzes, and exams made in class, whether you attended that day’s class or not. I may post the announcements and materials on Canvas and/or send them out as emails. If you anticipate needing to miss more than four class sessions, please make an appointment with me to discuss any restrictions on your availability early in the semester so we can find ways for you to participate and be successful in the course. Your attendance & participation will be gauged based on the following metrics:\n\nPunctuality to class and number of classes attended\nPreparedness for class (you will generally be considered prepared if you do the CPAs)\nLevel of engagement: Includes working collaboratively with others, sharing your thoughts during class discussions, and asking/answering questions.\nContributing to online collaboration work and discussion forums.\n\nPlease check the college attendance policy on the college-wide policies section.\n\n\nClass Preparation Assignments (CPAs)\nYou will read a short part of the course pack and/or watch a video in preparation for certain classes. After reading and/or watching, you will have a short assignment to complete in canvas. CPAs are an important part of your learning because they prepare you to participate in class meaningfully and to ask important questions to support your deeper understanding of the material.\nNote: CPAs will generally be graded for completion and effort. From time to time, there will be one question on the CPA that will be graded for accuracy. This question is meant to gauge the extent to which you understood the material on your own and answers may be discussed in class.\n\n\nProblem Posing\nThere will be a Problem Posing (PP) assignment at the end of every chapter. Problem posing is an opportunity for you to reflect on the material you have learned and to put it in use by creating problems of your own. You are welcome to use the problems done in class as a guide in creating your own problems. If you use problems from external sources (such as the internet) as a basis for generating your own problems, be sure to disclose the source.\n\n\nClass Quizzes\nThere will be a short quiz almost every week (usually Fridays) during the semester. The quizzes are meant to keep you up to speed with the material of the week. The quizzes will be closed-book and closed-notes.\n\n\nMidterm Exams\nThere will be three mid-term exams during the semester. Each mid-term exam will take about 50 minutes to complete and may draw partly from various student presentations. In order to do well on the test, you should pay close attention to student presentations even if it is not your group presenting. If something is not clear to you, please ask follow-up questions during the presentation or on Canvas discussion board. Information about the areas to be tested in the midterm exams will be provided before every exam. I will provide review problems ahead of time for you to complete out of class and then come to class ready to share your solutions with other students. These problems will not be graded but feedback will be provided during class presentations. Any errors that you make will be great opportunities to learn.\n\n\nProjects\nThere will be one major group project for this course this semester. Your group will be given an opportunity to choose a topic from a wide range of topics. You will have time in class to meet and discuss issues regarding your project before you present and submit it. During these times, I will provide you with feedback that you will use to improve your project in order to earn the best possible grade.\n\n\nFinal Portfolio\nThe final exam will consist of a portfolio with the following:\n\nAn oral presentation: you will be given a problem to work on and write a clear solution, submit to canvas, then come in for a 15-20 min meeting to explain your work.\nA one-page concept map illustrating the main ideas learned in the course and the relationships between them. I will provide examples of concept maps from other courses.\nAn essay (600 to 800 words) reflecting on your main takeaways from the course and how you would apply the knowledge gained in your field or other real-life situations.\n\n\n\nGrading Policy\nYour final letter grade in the course will be weighted by category as follows:\n\n\n\nCategory\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nAttendance and Participation\n5%\n\n\nClass Preparation Assignments\n10%\n\n\nProblem Posing\n15%\n\n\nClass Quizzes\n10%\n\n\nMidterm Exams\n20%\n\n\nProjects\n15%\n\n\nFinal Oral Presentation\n15%\n\n\n\nThe final letter grade will be determined based on the following thresholds:\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\nFinal Course Grade\n\n\n\n\nA\n\\(\\ge\\) 93\n\n\nA-\n90 - 92.99\n\n\nB+\n87 - 89.99\n\n\nB\n83 - 86.99\n\n\nB-\n80 - 82.99\n\n\nC+\n77 - 79.99\n\n\nC\n73 - 76.99\n\n\nC-\n70 - 72.99\n\n\nD+\n67 - 69.99\n\n\nD\n63 - 66.99\n\n\nD-\n60 - 62.99\n\n\nF\n\\(&lt;\\) 60",

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nThe point is very simple - you should not cheat. You should not present “someone” else’s work as your own.\nAbide by the following guidelines:\n\nCollaboration:\n\nWork that is not assigned as a collaborative assignment should not be completed collaboratively. This does not mean you should not seek support from peers. If you seek help from your peers, be sure that you write your own solutions, otherwise the work will be similar and flagged for cheating. Submitting similar work will be considered a violation of the academic integrity policy by all students involved.\nFor team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. Each group will submit one document contained agreed upon responses. No multiple file submissions.\n\nOn individual assignments you may not directly share work with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share work with another team in this class.\n\nOnline resources: In this century, the internet is a go to place for many things. While much of the information on the internet is useful, I expect that you will use it responsibly. The course policy is that you may use online resources (e.g., StackOverflow, Wolfram Alpha, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any solutions you directly use (or use as inspiration).\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT should be treated as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:\n\nCognitive dimension: Using AI tools should make you more efficient and productive rather than hampering your ability to think clearly and critically.\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content. AI is an integral part of this course and we will practice using generative AI tools responsibly without losing sight of the learning objectives.\n✅ AI tools: If you use AI in any way for course assignments, be sure to disclose it in your submission. Follow these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n❌ AI warning  AI-generated content may be inaccurate and even misleading in some cases. You will likely be temoted to use AI to write essays for this class but be warned that doing so in akin to copying and pasting someone else’s work. I suggest you use AI only to check your grammar or to generate an initial document that you should then sit down and edit to make sure it meets the need. Your experiences in this course will be unique and AI does not have any knowledge about these so it cannot generate a great essay.\n\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please contact your instructor.\n\n\nLate Work\nThe due date & time for all assignments will be posted on Canvas and/or emailed out and/or announced in class. To enable me to prepare for class meetings and give you feedback, I will not accept late work except under extreme circumstances. If you know that you won’t be able to turn in an assignment on time, reach out to me in writing (email) at least one day before the due date to discuss your options. Note that there will be no extensions on CPA’s.\n\n\nMobile devices & Other Technologies\nThis class allows use of technology devices (e.g., computers, tablets, etc.) only for purposes of the course. Such purpose includes taking notes, completing OneNote collaborative activities, among others. However, there will be moments (e.g., brief interactive discussion, completing paper activities) when I require that students put away (or turn off) their technology devices. Use of these devices for purposes other than the one for the course is prohibited. Research on this matter shows that it distracts you as well as other students in class. Two violations per week will result in a 0 score on the next attendance and participation grade. Persistent violation may necessitate further action to prevent you from distracting other students.\n\n\nTeams\nThis class will mostly run through small group work (teams). You will be randomly assigned to a team at the start of the semester. About midway into the semester, I will switch people teams based partly on my professional judgement. I will allow you to suggest members you would like to work with but there are no guarantees that you will get grouped with all members of your choice. I generally seek to have mixed ability teams and to ensure that everyone has a chance to work with different people. It is expected that every team member will contribute equally on team assignments.",

    "title": "MATH 104 - Finite Mathematics",
    "section": "Tips for Success",
    "text": "Tips for Success\nHere are a few basic suggestions for how to succeed in this course:\n\nKeep up with Homework\nIt is absolutely essential that you understand how to solve the assigned homework problems/exercises and, more importantly, how and why the skills and techniques presented in the course are used in solving the problems/exercises. I suggest that you begin working on the how as soon as possible. Do not pile your haw or work near the deadline. The advantage of getting the homework done on time is that you will get timely feedback that will help you understand the material better and hence do well in other assessment categories such as exams.\n\n\nAttend Class\nAs noted earlier, attendance is a critical part of your success in this course. You should try to attend every class because it is during class time that we will delve deeper into the course material and practice with applications.\n\n\nStay Caught Up\nMost concepts in this course build on each other cumulatively and you need to stay on top of the material at every stage. If you are having difficulty, don’t expect that the problem will take care of itself and disappear later. Contact me immediately and discuss the problem.\n\n\nCollaborate with Peers\nMany students benefit from sharing their work with others or by having their work questioned by their peers. You should attempt homework problems ahead of time by yourself and then note down any difficulties/questions that you can discuss with your peers. Even if you have no difficulties, you may still learn different and perhaps more efficient ways of solving the same problem during collaborative work. Below are some of the ways through which you can do this: - Canvas Discussion Forums & One Note Collaboration Space - You can post questions and answer others’ questions here. I encourage you to scan hand-written work (if necessary) and upload it alongside your question so people can see how you are thinking.\n\nZoom sessions – If you cannot meet in person, you can initiate Zoom sessions for collaborating. Zoom whiteboards are available to write on or you may simply have discussions. You can record these for later playback. If you want to invite me to your Zoom session, please send me an email with the link ahead of time and I will let you know if I am available to join.",

    "title": "MATH 104 - Finite Mathematics",
    "section": "College-wide Policies",
    "text": "College-wide Policies\n\nAttendance Policy\nStudents at Ithaca College are expected to attend all classes, and they are responsible for work missed during any absence from class. At the beginning of each semester, instructors must provide the students in their courses with written guidelines regarding possible penalties for failure to attend class. These guidelines may vary from course to course but are subject to the following conditions:\n\nIn accordance with Federal Law, students with a disability documented through Student Accessibility Services (SAS) may require reasonable accommodations to ensure equitable access. A student with an attendance accommodation, who misses a scheduled course time due to a documented disability, must be provided an equivalent opportunity to make up missed time and/or coursework within a reasonable time-frame. An accommodation that affects attendance is not an attendance waiver and no accommodation can fundamentally alter a course requirement. If a faculty member thinks an attendance-related accommodation would result in a fundamental alteration, concerns and potential alternatives should be discussed with SAS.\nIn accordance with New York State law, students who miss class due to their religious beliefs shall be excused from class or examinations on that day. The faculty member is responsible for providing the student with an equivalent opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirement that the student may have missed. Any such work is to be completed within a reasonable time frame, as determined by the faculty member.\nAny student who misses class due to a family or individual health emergency or to a required appearance in a court of law shall be excused. If the emergency is prolonged or if the student is incapacitated, the student or a family member/legal guardian should report the absence to the Dean of Students or the Dean of the academic school where the student’s program is housed. Students may consider a leave of absence, medical leave of absence, selected course withdrawals, etc., if they miss a significant portion of classwork. (Note: Graduate students may not take a leave of absence.)\nA student may be excused to participate in local, state, or federal elections. The student is responsible to make up any work that is missed due to the absence. Any such work is to be completed within a reasonable time frame, as determined by the faculty member.\n\nA student may be excused for participation in College-authorized co-curricular and extracurricular activities if, in the instructor’s judgment, this does not impair the specific student’s or the other students’ ability to succeed in the course. For all absences except those due to religious beliefs, the course instructor has the right to determine if the number of absences has been excessive in view of the nature of the class that was missed and the stated attendance policy.\nStudents should notify their instructors as soon as possible of any anticipated absences.\n\n\nStudent Accessibility Services\nIn compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, reasonable accommodation will be provided to students with documented disabilities on a case-by-case basis. Students must register with Student Accessibility Services and provide appropriate documentation to Ithaca College before any academic adjustment will be provided. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive, so timely contact with Student Accessibility Services is encouraged. To discuss accommodations or the accommodation process, students should schedule to meet with a SAS specialist. 607-274-1005 | sas@ithaca.edu.\n\n\nMental Health statement\nThe Ithaca College Center for Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) promotes and fosters the academic, personal, and interpersonal development of Ithaca College students by providing short-term individual, group, and relationship counseling, crisis intervention, educational programs to the campus community, and consultation for faculty, staff, parents, and students. Their team of licensed and licensed-eligible professionals value inclusivity, and they are dedicated to creating a diverse, accessible, and welcoming environment that is safe and comfortable for all those they serve and with whom they interact. CAPS sees students in-person at their offices in the Hammond Health building (side entrance), but Telehealth meetings through Zoom can be arranged in some circumstances. Staff in the office will answer questions by phone at 607-274-3136; please leave a voicemail if you do not reach a live person. You can also reach the office via email at counseling@ithaca.edu. CAPS hours remain Monday-Friday 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. After-hours connections to a live counselor are available by calling the CAPS number and following the prompts.\nIn the event I suspect you need additional support, expect that I will express to you my concerns. It is not my intent to know the details of what might be troubling you, but simply to let you know I am concerned and that help, if needed, is available. Remember, getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe College is an academic community, which values academic integrity and takes seriously its responsibility for upholding academic honesty. All members of the academic community have an obligation to uphold high intellectual and ethical standards. All forms of dishonesty including cheating and plagiarism are unacceptable. Failure to appropriately cite material used in a paper is plagiarism. The minimum penalty for cheating or plagiarism is a zero for the test or paper in question. Referral to college judiciaries is also possible. For more information on academic integrity and academic dishonesty, please refer to the Student Handbook, the College Catalog and the Code of Student Conduct and Related Policies or ask your instructor.\n\n\nTitle IX\nAt Ithaca College, we believe that every individual has the right to be treated with respect and dignity and we support the creation and maintenance of a safe and positive living and learning environment. Students who experience sexual violence (including dating violence, stalking and sexual assault), sexual harassment, or discrimination based on gender or sexual identity) are encouraged to report their experience to the Title IX Coordinator, lkoenig@ithaca.edu to explore formal and informal reporting options, and explore the support and resources available. The Title IX Coordinator will work with you to determine the best way to proceed and enhance the safety of our community. For more information go to: https://www.ithaca.edu/share.\nInformation shared in class assignments, class discussions, and at public events do not constitute an official disclosure, and faculty and staff do not have to report these to the Title IX Coordinator. Faculty and staff should be sure that access to campus and community resources related to sexual misconduct are available to students in the case these subjects do arise. Any other disclosure to faculty and staff can be reported to the Title IX Coordinator.\n\n\nAcademic Advising Center\nStudents are asked to consult with their faculty advisor, or the advising contact within their school, for all advising matters. Faculty advisors will be able to assist students with most advising questions, or they may collaborate with the dean’s office for more complicated matters. Students can find the name of their assigned faculty advisor in Homer or in Degree Works.\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\nIthaca College values diversity because it enriches our community and the myriad experiences that characterize an Ithaca College education. Diversity encompasses multiple dimensions, including but not limited to race, culture, nationality, ethnicity, religion, ideas, beliefs, geographic origin, class, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and expression, disability, and age. We are dedicated to addressing current and past injustices and promoting excellence and equity. Ithaca College continually strives to build an inclusive and welcoming community of individuals with diverse talents and skills from a multitude of backgrounds who are committed to civility, mutual respect, social justice, and the free and open exchange of ideas. We commit ourselves to change, growth, and actions that embrace diversity as an integral part of the educational experience and of the community we create.Please learn more about Ithaca College’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion: https://www.ithaca.edu/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-statement.",

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the course TA are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the posit cloud. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nInstall Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease.html\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"xxx\"), where xxx is the name of the package.\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the online computing environment (posit cloud).",

You are not asked to do an exhaustive data analysis by generating every statistic/visualizations that we have learned of in the course. Rather, I expect you to demonstrate skills in asking meaningful questions and answering them using carefully selected data analysis techniques and tools. These analyses must be done in R in a reproducible manner (quarto).\nMultiple data frames are available but your group will choose just one to use for this project. After choosing the data frame, your will need to brainstorm on several issues about the data such as the sample and sampling methods that might have been used to gather the data, a possible target population, variables and their types (numerical vs categorical), among others. Your team will then come up with a research topic/goal and two research questions (directly related to the topic) that you will answer by conducting the analyses. Your analyses should include data visualizations, numerical statistics, and regression models. All these must be appropriately linked to help tell a coherent story.",

    "text": "Milestone 1 - Proposal\nThere are two main purposes of the project proposal:\n\nTo help you think about the project early, so you can get a head start on finding data, reading relevant literature, thinking about the questions you wish to answer, etc.\nTo ensure that the data you wish to analyze, methods you plan to use, and the scope of your analysis are feasible and will allow you to be successful for this project.\n\nThe project proposal will be due roughly one week after the project is assigned. It must contain the following details:\n\nTeam members and their roles: List the names of all team members and their roles in the project. Roles can include Data cleaning/wrangling, Data analysis (performing the analyses in RStudio), Writing (e.g., abstract, intro, literature review, findings, conclusion), Proof reading and typo fixing, Team leader (e.g., setting up meetings, follow up, communicate with professor), etc.\nResearch topic and Questions: As indicated earlier, this is a short statement that describes the general area of interest that your research questions will be addressing. You should have at least two research questions that you will answer by conducting the analyses.\nData: Describe the data you will be using. This should include the source of the data, the number of observations and variables, and a brief description of the variables and their types (e.g., numerical, categorical). You should also include a brief description of the data collection process. Note that the data collection process may not be available for all data sets. In this case, you are allowed to speculate (reasonably) on the data collection process and be sure to mention that in your proposal.\nAnalysis plan: Describe the analyses you plan to conduct. This should include the types of visualizations you plan to create, the numerical summaries you plan to calculate, and the regression models you plan to fit. You should also describe how you plan to link these analyses together to tell a coherent story.\n\nInstructions and grading criteria for this milestone are outlined in the grading rubric for Milestone 1.",

The draft should include the following sections:\n\nAbstract: This section should provide a brief overview of the research topic, questions, data, and analyses you are conducting. It should also provide a brief overview of the results you have obtained. Think of the abstract as an executive summary of your work that someone can read and understand without reading the rest of the report. You should write the abstract last, after you have completed the rest of the report.\nIntroduction: This section should introduce the research topic and questions you are addressing. It should also provide a brief overview of the data you are using and the analyses you plan to conduct. Cite a few sources that are relevant to your research topic.\nLiterature Review: This section should provide a brief overview of the literature related to your research topic. You should cite at least 5 sources and synthesize their methods and findings in relation to your own research. Guidelines for writing an effective literature review can be found here.\nMethods: This section should describe the data you are using and the analyses you plan to conduct. It should include the following subsections:\n\nData Description: This section should describe the data you are using. This should include the source of the data, the number of observations and variables, and a brief description of the variables and their types (e.g., numerical, categorical). You should also include a brief description of the data collection process. Note that the data collection process may not be available for all data sets. In this case, you are allowed to speculate (reasonably) on the data collection process and be sure to mention that in your proposal.\nResearch Questions and Analyses: This section should list the research questions you are addressing. You should also describe the variables of interest in your data set that will help you answer these questions. Discuus the methids you plan to use for each question and why you think they are appropriate.\nData Cleaning: This section should describe the steps you took to clean the data. This may include removing missing values, transforming variables, etc. Depending on your data set, you may not need to do much data cleaning. If this is the case, you should still describe the steps you took to clean the data, even if they are minimal.\n\nData Analysis and Results: This is one of the most important heavily weighted parts of your project. The analyses should be sound and justified appropriately (under methods). Here, you just need to implement the analyses described under the methodology section of your paper. Your analyses should demonstrate a thorough understanding of statistical concepts learned in this course (and beyond, if you like). Your data analyses must include both numerical statistics and data visualizations. You must also use regression modelling (linear or logistic) techniques as part of your analyses. Interpretations of visualizations created as well as the models created must be made in a coherent manner and in the context of the research questions. These are the results/findings of your project.\nConclusion: This section should summarize the research questions you addressed, the data you used, the analyses you conducted, and the results you obtained. Findings of your study must be tied back to those reported in the literature review; for example, do your findings concur with previous studies or do they contradict them? It should also discuss the implications of your results and suggest directions for future research. Be sure to state any limitations of your study and what would be done differently if you were to do the study again.\nReferences: This section should list all the sources you cited in your report. Use APA format for your references.\n\nInstructions and grading criteria for this milestone are outlined in Milestone 2: Proposal.",

I may be able to have funds to sign up about 16 students this semester. The criteria is to have at least two group members with a full licence for the semester. Although the software has a free version, it allows only 25 hours of use per month. The positive side is that it does come with all the functionality that we will need for the course.\nGitHub: You will need to sign up for a free GitHub account. We will not use GitHub as much but you will need to sign up for a student developer pack to get access to GitHub copilot for free as a student. Be sure to use your Ithaca College email while signing up.\nGitHub Copilot: GitHub Copilot is free for students. You will need to sign up for the student developer pack before you sign up for a free GitHub copilot account.\n\nThe detailed instructions for signing up for GitHub copilot are available on this site",
