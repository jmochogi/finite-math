We begin by reintroducing the key ideas (e.g., data and data distributions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing) using modern approaches where applicable and then extend these techniques to more sophisticated statistical analysis tools like multiple regression and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Real world applications will be emphasized.",
